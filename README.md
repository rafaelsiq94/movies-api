# Movies API

This is a RESTful API for managing movies and their related data. It provides endpoints for retrieving movies and analyzing movie data.

## Installation

### Local Development

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rafaelsiq94/movies-api.git
   cd movies-api
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the Flask server:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The API should now be accessible at `http://localhost:5001/movies`.

### Docker

To run the project with Docker, make sure you have Docker installed on your system.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rafaelsiq94/movies-api.git
   cd movies-api
   ```

2. Build and start the Docker containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This command will build the Docker image and start the containers in detached mode.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access the API endpoints using a tool like cURL, Postman, or your web browser.

### Endpoints

- **GET /movies**: Retrieve a list of all movies.
- **GET /movies?projection=max-min-win-interval-for-producers**: Retrieve information about producers with the fastest and slowest consecutive wins.

### Running Tests

#### Locally

To run tests locally, make sure you have activated the virtual environment:

```bash
python test_runner.py
```

#### With Docker

Tests can also be run within the Docker container. Use the following command:

```bash
docker exec -it movies-api python test_runner.py
```
